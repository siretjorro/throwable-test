/**
 * Helps to handle automatic logouts. The automatic logout is locked until we are sure that we have logged back in.
 * logout() is called whenever a network request fails because of an unauthorized session.
 * Needs to be a singleton (object) to enforce global syncing of logout requests
 *
 * reset() is called in 2 places:
 * MainActivity.onCreate():
 *     - Main application screen => We have a proper session and are ready to handle any errors
 * PickCompanyFragment.onCreate():
 *     - During login we might see this screen before MainActivity => Let's be ready to handle errors
